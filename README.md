**Assignment-2**

**Position**
The Position class is a fundamental component in the "Gem Hunters" game, representing the coordinates of entities on the 2D game board, such as players, gems, and obstacles. It is designed to track the location of these entities within the game's grid-based system.

**Players**
The player represents a player in a game with basic functionality for movement and gem collection. It contains properties to track the player's name, position on a 2D grid, and the number of collected gems. The Position property is of a custom type, presumably a class or struct, that contains X and Y coordinates indicating the player's location on the grid.
